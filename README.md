# Implementation of Basic Protocols Using Cisco Packet Tracer

### Overview

🔌💻 Cisco Packet Tracer is a powerful network simulation tool used for teaching, training, and experimenting with network environments. This project focuses on implementing basic protocols using Cisco Packet Tracer to understand their functionality and behavior in simulated network scenarios.

### Key Protocols Implemented

- ***DHCP Protocol***: Configured Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to automatically assign IP addresses to devices within the network.
- ***APIPA Protocol***: Implemented Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) to assign IP addresses to devices when DHCP is not available.
- ***DNS Protocol***: Configured Domain Name System (DNS) services to resolve domain names to IP addresses within the network.
- ***FTP Protocol***: Set up File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for transferring files between devices in the network.
- ***ICMP Protocol***: Implemented Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) for diagnostic and error messages between network devices.
- ***SMTP Protocol***: Configured Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for sending email messages over the network.

### Simulation Setup

- Download the provided .pkt file and import it into Cisco Packet Tracer.
- The .pkt file contains a pre-configured network environment with all necessary devices and connections.
- Utilize the imported .pkt file for simulation, providing a ready-to-use network environment for hands-on practice.
